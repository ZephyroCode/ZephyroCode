## 👋🏻Hiya! I'm Zephyro!

Self-taught Jr. Frontend Web Developer looking forward to become a Fullstack Developer

I started studying Web Development in August 2021. I'm always coding some stuff for practicing, and I love to learn new stuff!

I love sharing what I know, so every time I learn something new, I love to share it with someone, or even teach it if I can!

You can also check my [Introduction](https://zephyrocode.github.io/2022/introduction/) post in my blog!
